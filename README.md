# 2.3 Test

'2.3 Test' was originally used for testing patches before their deployment to the main [2.3 Players Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1190476337) mod. However, due to a convoluted history, **2.3 Test is now a standalone mod which is the primary mod used for multiplayer in HWRM.**

2.3 Test does not make any provisions for singleplayer: the experience will likely be pretty unbalanced as all 2.3 Test changes are focused on multiplayer balancing.

### Authors

2.3 Test is 99.9% Fear (Novaras), however it builds on the main 2.3 Players Patch mod. As such, all credits there should be considered credits here.
